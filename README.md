- 👋 Hi, I’m @MongXinChan, coming from teochew where called one of The City of Gastronomy . Many of friends call me "Knowledgable person", by comparison I am nothing but a student learning less of what I want, so I have a niked name called "half-baked-knowledge"——which means I WILL LEARN MORE WHAT I DONOT KNOW, and so many thing I only konw donot undersand, I mean that I MERELY know what literally.
- 👀 I’m interested in READING , FILMING , MUSICING .Such as literate(such DRAMA(Espacially TeoChew Drama) , Shakespeare's works , the Chinese poems ect.) , psychology , AUTOBIOGRAPHY , Rock Music (saddly I donot like metal music, such as No Party For Cao Dong, 8 Immortals , Boli Band(In Chinese it literally like Broglie's theory mean the light have binary side-wave-or-particle) , SummerEscape(Alright it donnot really rock,but It's pretty sounds make me glad)) , Writing sometimes , Having a good eating(Because I come from Teochew >_< , okay,may it's so difficulty undersand.), Travelling(With a package and phone , a bottel of water , a protable-battery) .
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS61B in Java, I will start to learn CS106B if I finish my CS61B.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on : I donot have some influence for the industry now( Especially I donnot possess useful skills in the industry ). temporarily , I donnot consent to collaborate until I finish a project by myself alone.
- 📫 How to reach me : As far as I said that, temporarily I donont post my other REACH-OUT ways.
- 😄 Pronouns: Half-baked-knowledge,MongXin,Fan(or Fun,sometimes my friends call me function)
- ⚡ Fun fact: In my 4-year-old I set off my home alone, although my travelling was so beautiful--but the thing donot benefit for my parents , when they fonud me out off my home, firstly , they consider that I was stolen by the children-seller . Fortunately , I  have been seen by a well-heart-women, a mother with 2 or 3 children , who tell the policeman I get lost in another countryside-town.
